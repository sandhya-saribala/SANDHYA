PROBLEM1:
This program is a simple calculator built using a Python class. At the start, it prints a heading and then defines a class called Calculator. Inside the class, the __init__ method (constructor) is used, which automatically runs when an object of the class is created. The constructor takes three inputs: the first number, the second number, and the operation symbol (+, -, *, or /). Based on the operator entered, it performs the correct calculation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. If the operator is division, it also checks whether the second number is zero to prevent a division error. If the user enters an invalid operator, it displays a message saying “Invalid Operation.” After defining the class, the program takes input from the user for the two numbers and the operator. Finally, it creates an object of the Calculator class, which triggers the constructor and displays the result of the calculation. In short, the class handles the entire logic of the calculator, and the program gives the result immediately after the user enters the values.

PROBLEM2:
This program prints a series of odd numbers based on how many terms the user wants. First, it displays the heading and then asks the user to enter a number, which represents how many odd numbers should be printed. The variable i is set to 1, which is the first odd number, and count is used to keep track of how many odd numbers have been printed. A while loop runs until the count becomes equal to the number entered by the user. Inside the loop, the current odd number (i) is printed, and the program decides whether to print a comma or move to the next line depending on whether it is the last number or not. After printing, i is increased by 2 to get the next odd number, and count is increased by 1 to track progress. This continues until the required series of odd numbers is displayed.

PROBLEM3:

This program prints a conditional series of odd numbers based on the user’s input. First, it asks the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable a. Then it checks whether a is even or odd. If the number is even, it reduces the count by one (a - 1) so that the series length becomes odd; otherwise, if the number is already odd, it keeps the count the same. This ensures that the program always prints an odd-length series. Next, it initializes two variables: i (used to control how many numbers are printed) and num (which starts at 1, the first odd number). A while loop runs until i reaches the count. Inside the loop, the current odd number is printed. If it is not the last number in the series, a comma and space are printed after it for proper formatting. After each step, num is increased by 2 to generate the next odd number, and i is increased by 1 to keep track of progress. This process continues until the required odd series is printed.

PROBLEM4:

This program counts how many numbers in a given list are multiples of each number from 1 to 9. It starts by defining a list called nums containing several numbers. An empty dictionary result is created to store the counts for each divisor. The program then uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 9, treating each as a potential divisor. For each divisor d, a counter c is initialized to zero. Another for loop goes through each number n in the nums list and checks whether n is divisible by d using the modulus operator (n % d == 0). If it is divisible, the counter c is increased by 1. After checking all numbers for the current divisor, the count is stored in the result dictionary with the divisor as the key. Finally, the program prints the dictionary, which shows how many numbers in the list are multiples of each number from 1 to 9.
